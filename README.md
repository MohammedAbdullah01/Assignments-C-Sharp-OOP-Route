## Introduction

Welcome to the Assignments-C-Sharp-OOP-Route repository! This project is designed to help you learn and practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts using C#. The assignments cover a wide range of topics, from basic OOP principles to more advanced techniques.

## Assignments

### Assignment 1: Basics of OOP
- **Description:** Learn the basics of OOP, including classes, objects, and methods.
- **Files:** [Assignment1.cs](Assignments/Assignment1.cs)
- **Instructions:**
  1. Create a class named `Person`.
  2. Add properties for `Name`, `Age`, and `Gender`.
  3. Implement methods for setting and getting these properties.
  4. Create objects of the `Person` class and demonstrate their usage.

### Assignment 2: Inheritance
- **Description:** Understand the concept of inheritance in OOP.
- **Files:** [Assignment2.cs](Assignments/Assignment2.cs)
- **Instructions:**
  1. Create a base class named `Animal`.
  2. Add properties for `Name` and `Species`.
  3. Create a derived class named `Dog` that inherits from `Animal`.
  4. Add a method specific to the `Dog` class.
  5. Demonstrate the use of inheritance by creating objects of both classes.

### Assignment 3: Polymorphism
- **Description:** Learn about polymorphism and its implementation in C#.
- **Files:** [Assignment3.cs](Assignments/Assignment3.cs)
- **Instructions:**
  1. Create a base class named `Shape`.
  2. Add a virtual method named `Draw`.
  3. Create derived classes `Circle` and `Rectangle` that override the `Draw` method.
  4. Demonstrate polymorphism by calling the `Draw` method on objects of both derived classes.

### Assignment 4: Encapsulation
- **Description:** Practice encapsulation and data hiding in C#.
- **Files:** [Assignment4.cs](Assignments/Assignment4.cs)
- **Instructions:**
  1. Create a class named `BankAccount`.
  2. Add private fields for `accountNumber` and `balance`.
  3. Implement public methods for depositing and withdrawing money.
  4. Demonstrate encapsulation by creating and manipulating a `BankAccount` object.

### Assignment 5: Interfaces
- **Description:** Explore the use of interfaces in C#.
- **Files:** [Assignment5.cs](Assignments/Assignment5.cs)
- **Instructions:**
  1. Create an interface named `IShape`.
  2. Add a method signature for `CalculateArea`.
  3. Implement the `IShape` interface in classes `Circle` and `Square`.
  4. Demonstrate the use of interfaces by calculating areas of different shapes.
